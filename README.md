Tinkering With CSS Filter Effects
=============

A simple playground for CSS Filter Effects.

[CSS Filter Effects](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html) are an emerging part of CSS that aims to bring basic, Instagram or Photoshop-like filters to CSS.

CSS Filter Effects, are not, however, restricted to images. You can apply them to nearly any DOM element.

[This example](http://webinista.github.com/TinkeringWithCSSFilterEffects/) only uses the filter effects functions. It does not allow you to change the `filter-margin-top`, `filter-margin-bottom` `filter-margin-left`, `filter-margin-right` or `filter-margin` properties. Nor does it allow you to use SVG filters or custom filters with the `filter()` function.

As of November 2014, [CSS Filter Effects](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html) are [supported](http://caniuse.com/#search=css filter) without prefixes in Firefox 34+, and with a `-webkit-` vendor prefix in Chrome 18+, Safari 6+ and Opera 15+.
